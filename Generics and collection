Generics allow you to define a class with placeholders for the type of its fields, methods, parameters, etc.
Generics replace these placeholders with some specific type at compile time.








Collection classes are specialized classes for data storage and retrieval.
These classes provide support for stacks, queues, lists, and hash tables
Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects. 
Unlike arrays, the group of objects you work with can grow and shrink dynamically as the needs of the application change. 
For some collections,you can assign a key to any object that you put 
into the collection so that you can quickly retrieve the object by using the key.

1)ArrayList
2)Queue:fifo
3)stack:LIFO
